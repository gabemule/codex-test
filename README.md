# Codex

## Overview

**Codex** is a centralized repository that serves as the core hub of code, automation, and AI integration across multiple projects and pipelines. Inspired by ancient codices—volumes of knowledge meticulously compiled and preserved—Codex is designed to be the modern evolution of a knowledge base, bringing together essential code, automation patterns, and AI-driven workflows in one organized platform.
