## 🔭 Overview

**Codex** is a centralized repository that serves as the core hub of documentation generation, automation, and AI integration across multiple projects and pipelines. Inspired by ancient codices—volumes of knowledge meticulously compiled and preserved—Codex is designed to be the modern evolution of a knowledge base, bringing together essential documentation, automation patterns, and AI-driven workflows in one organized platform.

Just as ancient codices preserved humanity's knowledge through generations, our Codex aims to preserve and evolve development knowledge through AI-powered automation and standardization.
